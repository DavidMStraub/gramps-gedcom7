# Response to Testing Question

@giotodibondone Thank you for your interest! Yes, we have now tested the extensions, though not yet with addon PR 744. Here's what we've done:

## Testing Completed âœ…

1. **Created comprehensive test files** for each extension:
   - `occurrence_test.ged` - Census with 6 people, marriages, deaths
   - `evidence_test.ged` - Floating evidence with confidence levels  
   - `citation_test.ged` - Template-based citations
   - `tag_test.ged` - Organizational tags with colors
   - `combined_test.ged` - All extensions working together

2. **Successfully converted all test files** using the gedcom2xml command:
   ```bash
   python -m gramps_gedcom7.gedcom2xml test.ged output.gramps
   ```
   All files converted without errors to GRAMPS XML format.

3. **Fixed issues discovered during testing**:
   - Updated code to use enhanced processor for extension support
   - Added workaround for gedcom7 library not parsing TRLR
   - Fixed imports to use system GRAMPS installation

## Testing Environment

- GRAMPS 6.0.1 (Debian package)
- Python 3.12/3.13
- gedcom7 library 0.4.0
- Our fork with extension handlers

## What Still Needs Testing ðŸ”„

1. **With addon PR 744**: We haven't tested with the actual GRAMPS addon yet. Our testing was at the library level.

2. **GUI import**: Need to verify the extensions appear correctly in GRAMPS interface.

3. **Data mapping verification**: While files convert successfully, we need to confirm extension data is properly mapped to GRAMPS objects (events, notes, attributes).

## Known Issues

- The enhanced processor wasn't initially activated (now fixed)
- Extension URLs in our test files need updating to match final repositories
- Need to verify _TAG extension creates GRAMPS tags properly

## Next Steps

1. Test with addon PR 744 
2. Create video demonstration
3. Add debug logging to verify extension processing
4. Submit updated test files

Would you be interested in helping test once we have the addon integration working? The test files are in our fork's `test-files/` directory.

The extension support is functional at the library level - files parse and convert successfully. The critical next step is verifying the complete workflow with the GRAMPS addon.
